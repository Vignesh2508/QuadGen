# QuadGen
A Quadtree grid generator to identify the points. The bin capacity can be changed. The default value is set to 2. The code is in the initial phase. For the sake of visualization, I used pygame module. But the window will close automatically because it is not run in a while loop, which is normally the case for the pygame module. The edge cases and floating point to integer conversion for some funcitons makes this application not so accurate. But the base code can be developed into something more.
